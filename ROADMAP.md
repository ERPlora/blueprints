# Blueprints Roadmap

Business types and sectors removed from Phase 1 for future implementation.

---

## Eliminated Sectors (complete)

These sectors were removed entirely. They require deep integrations, heavy regulation, or address markets where ERPlora's POS model is not a natural fit.

### Transport & Logistics
- `courier` — Transport / Courier
- `vehicle_rental` — Vehicle Rental
- `moving_company` — Moving Company
- `logistics_3pl` — 3PL / Logistics Operator
- `parking` — Parking

**Why:** GPS tracking, route optimization, fleet management, real-time hardware (barriers/tickets).

### Pharmacy & Health (regulated)
- `pharmacy` — Pharmacy
- `orthopedics` — Orthopedics
- `cbd_shop` — CBD Shop / Cannabis Herbalist

**Why:** Integration with public health systems (receta electronica), Botplus, strict pharmaceutical regulation. `health_store` and `nutrition_shop` were moved to Retail (no regulation).

### NGO & Non-profit
- `nonprofit` — NGO / Association
- `property_management` — Property Management
- `professional_college` — Professional College
- `brotherhood` — Brotherhood / Guild
- `social_club` — Social Club

### Technology & Digital
- `software` — Software Development
- `msp` — IT Services / MSP
- `web_agency` — Web / Digital Marketing Agency
- `hosting` — Hosting / Data Center
- `telecom` — Telecommunications / ISP

### Travel & Tourism
- `travel_agency` — Travel Agency
- `tour_operator` — Tour Operator / Activities
- `tour_guide` — Independent Tour Guide

**Why:** Requires GDS integration (Amadeus), booking engine APIs. Inviable without deep partnerships.

### Financial Services
- `currency_exchange` — Currency Exchange
- `pawnshop` — Pawnshop
- `debt_collection` — Debt Collection
- `insurance_brokerage` — Insurance Brokerage

**Why:** Heavy regulation (Banco de Espana, CNMV), KYC/AML compliance.

### Maritime & Nautical
- `marina` — Marina / Sports Port
- `fishing_company` — Fishing Company
- `nautical_workshop` — Nautical Workshop

**Why:** Maritime regulation, very niche geographic market.

### Funeral Services
- `funeral_home` — Funeral Home
- `cemetery` — Cemetery / Crematorium
- `mortuary` — Mortuary

**Why:** Highly regulated, concession-based market. Closed ecosystem.
